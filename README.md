# Library Management System

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Library Management System** using **SQL**. It focuses on designing a normalized relational database, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries to manage and analyze library data.

#Objectives

* **Set Up Database Schema**  
  Create tables for managing:
  * branches
  * employees
  * members
  * books
  * issued_status
  * return_status

* CRUD Operations
  Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations across all tables.

* CTAS (Create Table As Select)
  Use CTAS to create temporary or summary tables based on custom query results.

* Advanced SQL Queries
  Perform complex queries such as:
  * Joins across multiple tables  
  * Aggregate functions  
  * Subqueries  
  * Date-based filters (e.g., members registered in the last 180 days)  
  * Conditional logic
